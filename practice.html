    <h1>Welcome to My HTML Practice Page</h1>
    
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This page is an example of how to structure content using HTML. It contains headings, paragraphs, and even a hyperlink to an external resource. The goal is to practice building a basic web page layout.</p>
    
    <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML is the backbone of web development. It allows developers to structure their content and present it in a user-friendly way. If you'd like to learn more about HTML, visit the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs on HTML</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>Future Goals</h4>
    <p>In the future, I plan to learn more about CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity to web pages. Combining these technologies will help me create dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>
